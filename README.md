  - **Adult Test**: Uses number-based images.
  - **Kids Test**: Uses fun animal-based images.
- **Animated Image Transitions**: Smooth animations when new images are loaded in the kids' test.
- **Interactive UI**: Users receive immediate feedback after each answer, and a progress bar shows their progress throughout the test.
- **Results Summary**: Displays the number of correct answers at the end of the test.
- **Restart Option**: Users can restart the test at any time.
- **Popup Navigation**: The tests are loaded inside a fullscreen popup when selected from the main page.
